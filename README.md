# DataJournalism
### Hello!
#### _This is for my Data Journalism Course at Lehigh University._<br/>
My name is Arava and I am an International Relations and Journalism double major at Lehigh. I created this repository for my data journalism class and this is where I will put anything coding related for that course. <br/> To introduce myself, I have been interested in journalism and communication for as long as I can remember. I was on my elementry school's newspaper from fourth through sixth grade. I took graphic design classes in middle school and as soon as I could, I joined yearbook in ninth grade. I was on yearbook staff for all four years of my high school carerr, eventually becoming co-editor-in-chief my senior year and creating a nationally award-winning book. So, it was the natural progression for me to become a journalism major. <br/> My interest in international relations can probably be traced back to being surrounded by politics, national and international affairs, and the government. I mean how could I not become interested. But I specifically am pursuing IR over political science, because while I love U.S. history and studying the government, I think there is something so interesting learning about how other countries around the world deal with politics and governing and then comparing back to my preconcived U.S. standards. <br/>
